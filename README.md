Learning design is the art of creating a set of activities which will help people to gain knowledge, develop skills or change behaviours.

This book is aimed at those who are new to doing learning design, but there will also be a lot in it for people who have been practising for many years!

Those who have worked with me will testify that I'm constantly challenging the status quo - a strategy that sometimes works, but often falls on deaf ears.

My hope is that this book will offer an opportunity to explore some of the ideas I have been promoting over the years, and that it will be a chance for readers to look at learning design with a fresh point of view.
